This is the first Neural Network project done in 365DataScience's Data Science with Python course.

Content includes:
  1) Retrieving data from tensorflow_datasets module
  2) Seperating the data into training, test and validation subsets
  3) Scaling the dataset values before forwarding into the model
  4) Shuffling the data for a valid training of the NN model
  5) Model set up with layers from TF/Keras libray
  6) Optimizer and Loss function set ups
  7) Training and testing the model
